An Explorational West Nile Virus Classification

West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the continental
United States, according to the U.S. CDC. Currently, there is no vaccine that could avoid the
spread of WNV nor is there any medication product available to cure the patients suffering
from this virus. We were inspired by the current outbreak of the COVID-19 to use machine
learning techniques to predict the presence of the disease in a specific region. What we decided
to handle is a classification problem. The original data was obtained via Kaggle published by
the Chicago Department of Public Health.
